    <p>
      This feature offers the possibility to search through ABAP source code for given patterns
      <br />
      The search comes in two flavors:
    </p>

    <h3 id="client-based" class="heading">Client-Based</h3>
    <p>
      In the client-based approach, the existing ADT REST API is used to search for relevant objects in the ABAP system.
      Once the source code is retrieved, the search is performed in the client. Due to the used APIs the client-based
      search only works with a minimum ABAP version of 7.51 and a connected HANA database.
    </p>

    <h4 class="heading">Supported Environments</h4>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>ABAP Platform 7.51+</li>
      <li>S/4HANA</li>
      <li>S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition</li>
      <li>S/4HANA Public Cloud Edition</li>
      <li>BTP ABAP Environment</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="server-based" class="heading">Server-Based</h3>
    <p>
      The ABAP Code Search plug-in communicates with the corresponding ABAP backend to perform the search completely in
      the ABAP system. Only the match results are reported back to the client.
    </p>
    <h4 class="heading">Supported Environments</h4>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>ABAP Platform 7.40+</li>
      <li>S/4HANA</li>
      <li>S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="alert important">
      <div class="alert-important__text"></div>
      The Server-Based search is only usable if the necessary ABAP Coding is available in the ABAP Project you are
      working on. For detailed installing instructions look here:
