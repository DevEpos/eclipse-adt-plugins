    <h3 class="heading">General Settings</h3>
    <p>In the preferences menu you have the possibility to configure
        the following settings
    <h4 class="heading">Search Dialog Settings</h4>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Settings for Includes
            <ul class="list">
                <li><em>Use from previous search</em> <br>This option
                    controls whether the control settings for Class Includes, Function
                    Group Includes and Program Includes are taken over from the
                    previously executed search</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Single Pattern Mode
            <ul class="list">
                <li><em>Concatenate lines of the search pattern with '\n'
                        for regular expressions</em> <br> This option is relevant if the
                    entered pattern has multiple lines and you have activated the
                    options: <i>Regular Expressions</i> and <i>Single Pattern Mode</i>.
                    <br> By activating this option the system will automatically
                    enhance the entered pattern with a new line character after each
                    line of the pattern and consider it a single pattern for the
                    search. <br>A recommendation to use this option deactivated is
                    that if you structure very complex patterns you can divide them in
                    different lines for a better overview but you still want it to be
                    considered a single pattern
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Settings for Transport Request Filter<br>
            The task/transport requests displayed in the autocomplition (or in the F4 value help)
            can be restricted by default with the following filters:
            <ul class="list">
                <li><em>owner set to the logon user</em></li>
                <li><em>status of the task/transport request</em></li>
                <li><em>date of the release</em></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="heading">Search Settings</h4>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><em>Objects to search in a single API call</em> <br>
            For the serial processing of the search, this setting controls how many objects
            will be searched during a single back end call in an ongoing search query.</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
