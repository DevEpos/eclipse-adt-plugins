    <p>In the preferences menu you have the possibility to configure the following settings</p>
    <h3 class="heading">Search Dialog Settings</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        Settings for Includes
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <em>Use from previous search</em> <br />This option controls whether the control settings for Class
            Includes, Function Group Includes and Program Includes are taken over from the previously executed search
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Single Pattern Mode
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <em>Concatenate lines of the search pattern with '\n' for regular expressions</em> <br />
            This option is relevant if the entered pattern has multiple lines and you have activated the options:
            <i>Regular Expressions</i> and <i>Single Pattern Mode</i>. <br />
            By activating this option the system will automatically enhance the entered pattern with a new line
            character after each line of the pattern and consider it a single pattern for the search. <br />A
            recommendation to use this option deactivated is that if you structure very complex patterns you can divide
            them in different lines for a better overview but you still want it to be considered a single pattern
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Settings for Transport Request Filter
        <p>
          For convencience, the transport requests/tasks that are retrieved via content assist, can be restricted by
          following settings:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <em>Restrict owner to logged user</em><br />Only the tasks and requests belonging to the logged on user are
            shown
          </li>
          <li><em>Modifiable</em><br />Tasks/requests that are not yet released are included</li>
          <li>
            <em>Released</em><br />Released tasks/requests are shown. Use the drop-down menu to control how far back in
            time the selection should be made.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Additionally, the default pattern for tasks/requests - as used by <code class="code">SE09</code> - is used to
          restrict the result (e.g in case of the system id being <code class="code">A4H</code> the pattern will be
          <code class="code">A4H*</code>)
        </p>
        <div class="alert info">
          <div class="alert-tip__text"></div>
          By using the integrated value help via <code class="code">F4</code>, these settings can all be overridden
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
