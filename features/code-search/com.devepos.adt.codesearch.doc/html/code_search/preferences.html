    <p>In the preferences menu you have the possibility to configure the following settings</p>
    <h3 class="heading">Search Dialog Settings</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        Settings for Includes
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <em>Use from previous search</em> <br />This option controls whether the control settings for Class
            Includes, Function Group Includes and Program Includes are taken over from the previously executed search
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Single Pattern Mode
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <em>Concatenate lines of the search pattern with '\n' for regular expressions</em> <br />
            This option is relevant if the entered pattern has multiple lines and you have activated the options:
            <i>Regular Expressions</i> and <i>Single Pattern Mode</i>. <br />
            By activating this option the system will automatically enhance the entered pattern with a new line
            character after each line of the pattern and consider it a single pattern for the search. <br />A
            recommendation to use this option deactivated is that if you structure very complex patterns you can divide
            them in different lines for a better overview but you still want it to be considered a single pattern
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Settings for Transport Request Filter
        <p>
          For convencience, the transport requests/tasks that are retrieved via content assist, can be restricted by
          following settings:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <em>Restrict owner to logged user</em><br />Only the tasks and requests belonging to the logged on user are
            shown
          </li>
          <li><em>Modifiable</em><br />Tasks/requests that are not yet released are included</li>
          <li>
            <em>Released</em><br />Released tasks/requests are shown. Use the drop-down menu to control how far back in
            time the selection should be made.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Additionally, the default pattern for tasks/requests - as used by <kbd>SE09</kbd> - is used to restrict the
          result (e.g in case of the system id being <kbd>A4H</kbd> the pattern will be <kbd>A4H*</kbd>)
        </p>
        <div class="alert tip">
          <div class="alert-tip__text"></div>
          By using the integrated value help via <kbd>F4</kbd>, these settings can all be overridden
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="heading">Client-Based Search</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        <em>Maximum Number of parallel jobs</em><br />This setting controls the maximum number of parallel jobs that can
        be used for client-based searches.
        <div class="alert warning">
          <div class="alert-warning__text"></div>
          Be careful about this setting. Depending on the available resources this setting may have a performance impact
          on both the client and the targeted ABAP system.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Determine Package Hierarchy</em><br />If active this settings determines the package hierarchy of each main
        object in the search result
        <div class="alert tip">
          <div class="alert-tip__text"></div>
          In comparison with the server-based search the package hierarchy is determined on a per-object basis. If you
          you do not care about the hierarchy at all it may be better to deactivate this setting to improve the
          performance of the search.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Prefer Client-Based Search</em><br />If active this setting prefers client-based search over server-based
        Search. This is only relevant for ABAP systems where the ADT backend for the ABAP Code Search is installed
      </li>
    </ul>
